pgb-cloud9.io-readable
=====================

Sign up for cloud9
Create a new box and use the option "from URL" and use this URL:
https://github.com/LukarioMC/pgb-cloud9.io-readable.git

Once your box is created and starts go in a terminal type "npm install"

Find the cloud9.js file and right click then choose run
Note: only run the cloud9.js file, if you run another type of file it will more than likely load an apache2 webserver and will stop the correct application from running.

To fix the apache2 webserver go in to a terminal and type "killall -9 apache2"
Then run the cloud9.js file.

To see your website press "preview" on the top toolbar and click "preview running application"

Enter the URL from c9 to a new tab or your phonegap developer app.
